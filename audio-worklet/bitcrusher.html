<!-- 
	This code illustrates a web audio bitcrusher implementation, a musical audio 
	effect. The bitcrusher class defined in bitcrusher.js binds the script 
	processor node's onaudioprocess method to a bitcrush function, which reduces 
	the precision of individual samples and simulates a sample rate reduction by a
	specified factor. These parameters can be modified as the source 
	(an oscillator or loaded mp3 file) is running concurrently.
