  This code illustrates a web audio bitcrusher implementation, a musical audio 
  effect. The bitcrusher class defined in bitcrusher.js binds the script 
  processor node's onaudioprocess method to a bitcrush function, which reduces 
  the precision of individual samples and simulates a sample rate reduction by a
  specified factor. These parameters can be modified as the sound source is 
  running concurrently.
